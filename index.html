<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Moira, I also use Arlo. I'm an artist who does mainly traditional art via pencil and paper or watercolor, and I also do graphic design. A few more things about me is that I do martial arts, I'm a member of poetry club, and that I'm an avid debator. Aka I tend to be
 extremely opinionated. This can be both a good and bad thing. Either way, I am planning to go to collage for grapic design. I'm 16 and a junior at North Platte High School and I plan to go to DSU(Dakota State University) in South Dakota for collage. While I'll be majoring in graphic
 design, I also want to major in traditional art and minor in cyber security and in forensic science. This page isnt only a homework asignment for web design, it's personal research and my oppertunity to show people what I know via a website. I've been studying art and anatomy for
 around 7 years now. I'm really exited about creating this website so I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<h2>Why we Created this</h2>
<p>As I previously said, this is a web design assignment, but thats not necessarily why I'm creating this website the way I am. I'm doing it to show my skills, to make myself proud and to prove that all my hard work and study isnt for nothing. I'm making it the way I am so I can
 show that I am well educated and that im capable of a lot more that people think. I have studied for just under half of my life for this and will continue to study until I have nothing more to learn about and this is simply the first step of that. of course I still am doing this for a
grade. Regardless this is more to me than a grade. I can get grades for anything. But getting a grade for something I want to get a grade for, something I'm passionate about and something that isnt taught in school is much more rewarding that one might percieve at first.  </p>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>What this website is going to be about in general is art if you couldnt guess hat already. But more specifically types of art and what they entail. First we will have different types of art, mostly general ones that most people have encountered in their life. Then we will look
 at digital and physical art separately. Keep in mind, I wont be taking about music, dance, or performance art. Mostly sculpting, animation, painting, drawing Etc Etc. Mostly popular forms of art or things that would be under the same umbrella as the things you learn in art
 classes this is mostly because that is what I study, that is what I know and that is what I'm interested about.  </p>
